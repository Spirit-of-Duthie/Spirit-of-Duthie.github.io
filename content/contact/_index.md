There are a few options for a 'system' on the website to allow booking dinner, submitting abstracts, and voting for TOTY.

## Option 1 - Pre-filled emails

These are really simple, and might seem 'unsophisticated', but actually result in the same thing as the form processors below (while just ping an email to you with the stuff that's put in the form).

[Book dinner](mailto:oxbone.org@gmail.com?cc=robmac1986@gmail.com&subject=Reservation for Duthie Day dinner&body=How many Tickets do you want?%0D%0A%0D%0AWhat dietary requirements do you have?%0D%0A%0D%0APlease send payment to BACS Details, or cheques to Postal address. Once payment is processed, your ticket will be emailed to the email address you used to send this message. Please print and bring with you on the day)
*Don't forget* to send payment when you book!


[Submit Abstract](mailto:oxbone.org@gmail.com?cc=robmac1986@gmail.com&subject=Duthie Day Abstract Submission&body=Name:%0D%0A%0D%0AST year:%0D%0A%0D%0AAbstract title:%0D%0A%0D%0AAbstract text:%0D%0A%0D%0AIf you have a figure, please attached to this email)

[Vote for Trainer of the Year](mailto:oxbone.org@gmail.com?cc=robmac1986@gmail.com&subject=Duthie Day TOTY Nomination&body=TOTY nomination:%0D%0A%0D%0AReason:%0D%0A%0D%0)

## Option 2 - Via Google form

Again, simple and free. The form can be either as a link:

[Book, Submit, Vote](https://forms.gle/LD4GFc5Qt3zdRGs27)

Which takes you away from the site, but as people will be using it differnetly on the day versus in the run up, I don't think its an issue.

We could also embed within the page:

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXHt5-0kppwd2qWv7i2L9trcToFoyi3VH8RphcxxK-k7At9g/viewform?embedded=true" width="320" height="953" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loadingâ€¦</iframe>

## Option 3 - Using a HTML form

The advantage of this is it looks fancy, but in reality, all this does is send the contents of the form in an email to a nominated address. For the free tier, there is a 50 message per month limit, and with the three forms, I realistically think we would need to have a different email for each, plus each form needs to be discplayed below the others in order.
