## Option 2 - Via Google form

Again, simple and free. The form can be either as a link:

[Book, Submit, Vote](https://forms.gle/LD4GFc5Qt3zdRGs27)

Which takes you away from the site, but as people will be using it differnetly on the day versus in the run up, I don't think its an issue.

We could also embed within the page:

## Option 3 - Using a HTML form

The advantage of this is it looks fancy, but in reality, all this does is send the contents of the form in an email to a nominated address. For the free tier, there is a 50 message per month limit, and with the three forms, I realistically think we would need to have a different email for each, plus each form needs to be discplayed below the others in order.
