Welcome to Duthie Day! This year, our chief resident James Duncan will host the event on behalf of the OOTA committee at the Sultan Nazrin Shah Centre, Worcester College, Oxford.

Registration begins at 8:30am, with a brief welcome address from James at 08:55 before the day begins in force.


## Chief resident's address
THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated.

## Our sponsors

We would like to thank our sponsors, without whom this day would not be possible. We would encourage everyone to visit the stands to take part in the competition for a chance to win some very generous prizes.
