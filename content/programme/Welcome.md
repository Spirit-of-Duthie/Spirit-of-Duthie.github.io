Welcome to Duthie Day! This year, our chief resident Rob McCulloch will host the event on behalf of the OOTA committee at the Sultan Nazrin Shah Centre, Worcester College, Oxford.

Registration begins at 8:30am, with a brief welcome address from Rob before the day begins in force.


## Our sponsors

We would like to thank our sponsors, without whom this day would not be possible. We would encourage everyone to visit the stands to take part in the competition for a chance to win some very generous prizes.
