No I'm not tryin' to be rude
But hey, pretty girl, I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things you do
Remind me of my Lexus coupé
That's why I'm all up in your grill
Tryin' to get you to a hotel
You must be a football coach
The way you got me playin' the field
Now gimme that toot toot
And I'll give you that beep beep
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on 24s
While they say on the radio...
This is the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on Coke and rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend, baby
I'm about to have me some fun
Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce…
