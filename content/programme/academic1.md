#### Serious adverse events and long-term revision risk following shoulder replacement for acute trauma: a population cohort study of 14 052 patients from Hospital Episode Statistics data

##### Aims
To provide more accurate estimates of perioperative risks, complications and revision rates in patients having shoulder replacement surgery for acute proximal humeral fractures.
##### Methods
Shoulder replacements performed for acute fractures were identified within the HES database, together with all linked prior and follow-up episodes. Patients aged ≥50 years were included. The incidence of serious systemic adverse events was calculated at 30 and 90 days post-surgery. Revision risk was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
##### Results
14 052 procedures were included (10 843 in women). The median age was 74 (IQR 67 to 80). Overall, 9.7% of patients experienced a serious adverse event within 30 days. By type these were: death 1.2%, pulmonary embolism 0.5%, myocardial infarction 0.6%, pneumonia 4.0%, acute kidney injury 1.8%, urinary tract infection 3.7%, stroke 0.5%. Adverse events were strongly associated with increasing age, multimorbidity and male sex, but not implant type.
639 patients underwent revision surgery. More than 200 others needed additional shoulder surgery (without implant revision), and half of these were to address early post-operative stiffness, particularly following hemiarthroplasty. Revision rates across implant types at 5, 10 and 15 years were 4.9%, 5.8% and 6.3%.
##### Conclusions
One in ten patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty for trauma experienced a serious adverse event within 30 days. The risk of revision surgery appears low, but long-term data on RTSA is lacking. Strategies to reduce serious adverse events in the first 30 days should be a priority for upper limb trauma service providers.

#### Modifiable Risk Factors for Mortality in Revision Total Hip Replacement for Periprosthetic Fracture

##### Aims
The aim of this study was to identify modifiable risk factors associated with mortality in patients requiring revision total hip replacement for periprosthetic hip fracture (PPHF).

##### Methods
Electronic records for those patients undergoing revision total hip replacement for PPHF between December 2011 and October 2018 were reviewed. Potential risk factors identified for study included age, gender, body mass index, American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status classification, pre-operative haemoglobin, time to surgery, duration of surgery, blood transfusion, length of hospital stay and post-operative surgical and medical complications. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine independent modifiable risk factors for mortality at one year post-operatively.

##### Results
203 patients were identified (53% female, median age 79 [IQR: 71-86]). The median time to surgery was 3 days [IQR: 2-5]. Mortality rate at one year was 13.8% (n=28). The commonest surgical complication was dislocation (n=22, 10.8%). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that risk of death at one year post-operatively increased fivefold in patients who sustained a dislocation (OR 5.03 [95% CI:1.60-15.83] p=0.006). Risk of death increased fourfold for patients who developed hospital acquired pneumonia within 90 days post-operatively (OR 4.43 [95% CI:1.55-12.67] p=0.005). No evidence was found that time to surgery was a risk factor for death at one year.

##### Conclusion
Dislocation and hospital acquired pneumonia following revision total hip replacement for PPHF have not been previously reported as independent potentially modifiable risk factors for mortality. Our study suggests that surgeons should consider increasing constraint to reduce dislocation risk and the early involvement of the multidisciplinary team to reduce the risk of hospital acquired pneumonia post-operatively. In our study, there was no evidence that time to surgery affected mortality, which may allow time for medical optimisation, surgical planning, and resource allocation.

#### Is Knee joint distraction a viable treatment option for knee OA?

##### Aims
Knee joint distraction (KJD) is a new application of an established technique to regenerate native cartilage using an external fixator. The purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine whether KJD is beneficial for knee osteoarthritis and how results compare to established treatments.

##### Methods
Studies assessing the outcomes of KJD were retrieved, with three studies (one cohort, two randomized controlled trials), 62 knees, meeting inclusion criteria. The primary outcome was functional outcome, assessed using a validated outcome score, at one year. Secondary outcomes included: pain scores, structural assessment of the joint and adverse events.



##### Results
KJD is associated with improvements in WOMAC from baseline to one year as well as reductions in pain scores and improvements in structural parameters assessed radiographically and by MRI. KJD is not associated with decreased knee flexion, but is associated with a high risk of pin site infection. In patients aged 65 years or under at one year no differences in WOMAC or pain scores was detected between patients managed with KJD compared to high tibial osteotomy or total knee arthroplasty.

##### Conclusions
KJD may represent potential treatments for knee arthritis though further appropriately powered trials with longer term follow up are required to establish its efficacy compared to contemporary treatments.

#### A UK based expert consensus on key performance & training parameters in primary total hip replacement (THR)

##### Aims
An assessment of agreement between surgical trainers about the critical steps of a primary THR has not been previously undertaken. The aims of this study were to define the key steps of a primary THR, and subsequently produce a rank-order list of each defined step in achieving both a successful patient outcome, and the difficulty of teaching each step to trainees.

##### Methods
Questionnaires were circulated to consultant orthopaedic surgeons, and participants were asked to rate a list of 26 steps of a primary THR on a 3-point Likert scale for importance in determining patient outcomes after surgery, and on a binary scale for ease of teaching each step to their trainees (total 52 parameters). The benchmark for ‘group consensus’ was set at 80% agreement in any category for each step of a THR. All steps for which consensus was achieved in round 1 (R1) were removed in round 2 (R2).

##### Results
A total of 50 consultants completed R1, and 28 completed R2. Consensus was achieved in 27/52 parameters in R1, and one further step was added for R2 following feedback. 27 parameters were assessed in R2, and consensus was achieved in a 6, leaving a total of 21 parameters without group consensus (11 for impact on patient outcome, and 10 for difficulty in teaching). For these parameters the change between overall agreement between R1 and R2 was <10% in 14 parameters, <20% in 6 parameters, and <30% in 1 parameter.

##### Conclusion
The results of this study provide evidence to help guide specific training interventions in order to enhance trainees learning in the key steps of a primary THR. The expert consensus has identified these steps as the most critical in order to achieve optimum patient outcomes, or which are particularly difficult to learn directly from a supervising consultant in the theatre environment.

#### Identification of healthy and tendinopathic cell sub-types using single cell transcriptomics of foot and ankle tendons

Tendinopathy can commonly occur around the foot and ankle resulting in isolated rupture, debilitating pain and degenerative foot deformity. The pathophysiology and key cells involved are not fully understood. This is partly because the dense collagen matrix that surrounds relatively few resident cells limits the ability of previous techniques to identify and target those cells of interest. In this study, we apply novel single cell RNA sequencing (CITE-Seq) techniques to healthy and tendinopathic foot/ankle tendons. For the first time we have identified multiple sub-populations of cells in human tendons. These findings challenge the view that there is a single principal tendon cell type and open new avenues for further study.

Healthy tendon samples were obtained from patients undergoing tendon transfer procedures; including tibialis posterior and FHL. Diseased tendon samples were obtained during debridement of intractable Achilles and peroneal tendinopathy, and during fusion of degenerative joints.

Single cell RNA sequencing with surface proteomic analysis identified 8 sub-populations of human tendon derived cells. In addition to endothelial cells, Tc cells, and macrophages, there are five distinct tenocyte populations expressing COL1A genes. These consist of a population of resident cells expressing microfibril associated genes (FBN1, VCAN, DCN, EMILIN1, MFAP5), a group of SCX+ cells co-expressing high levels of pro-inflammatory markers, a population of APOD+ fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), chondrogenic cells (COMP, CILP, PRG4) and ITGA7+ Smooth Muscle-Mesenchymal cells, recently described in mouse muscle but not, as yet, in human tendon. Surface proteomic analysis identified markers by which these sub-classes could be isolated and targeted in future.
In comparison to healthy tendon, diseased tendon harboured a greater proportion of SCX+ tendon cells expressing high levels of pro-inflammatory markers including CXCL1, CXCL6, CXCL8, PDPN and previously undescribed PTX3. We were also able to show that whereas disease associated genes such as CD248 and PDPN were expressed by COL1+ tenocytes, IL33 was restricted to endothelial cells of diseased tendon.
