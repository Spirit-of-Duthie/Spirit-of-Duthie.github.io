Presentations from our clinical trainees who, despite no dedicated time for research, have been involved in clinical trials and developing new patient pathways. Themes this year include:

1. Randomised controlled trials in fracture management
2. Novel techniques described for arthritis treatment
3. Teaching and training
4. National level guideline development and assessment

At the end of the day, there will be live voting and prizes for the best presentations.

Presentations will last six minutes, with time for questions after every third candidate.
