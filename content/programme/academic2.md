Oxford has a strong commitment to academia, often based at the Botnar. At any given time, about one fifth of our trainees are out of training for dedicated research time, often for a higher degree. This session will showcase some of the work going on in region.

#### Low rates of revision and adverse events after surgery for base of thumb osteoarthritis: analysis of a national cohort of 43 076 surgeries in England

##### Aims
Surgery for base of thumb osteoarthritis (BTOA) remains a common treatment despite a scarcity of data on the safety and effectiveness. We aimed to identify the incidence of further intervention, local and systemic complications after BTOA surgery, and the patient factors associated.

##### Methods
We included all BTOA surgeries undertaken in England using the national Hospital Episode Statistics dataset linked to mortality records from 01/04/1998 until 31/03/2017. Primary outcomes were the incidence of further intervention and post-operative local and systemic complications within 30 and 90 days of surgery. Fine and Gray model regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing adverse outcome, adjusting for the competing risk of mortality.

##### Results
43 076 primary BTOA surgeries were performed during the 19-year study period. The overall rate of further intervention after any surgery was 1.39%; highest rate was seen after arthroplasty, the lowest rate following simple trapeziectomy. Male gender and being younger at the time of surgery were associated with revision risk. Previous intra-articular steroid injection was not associated with an increased risk of local complications.  

Overall complication rates following surgery were 0.21% within 30 days, 0.22% within 90 days for local complications and 0.20% within 30 days, 0.58% within 90 days for systemic complications.

##### Conclusions
The number of patients proceeding to BTOA surgery has increased. There is a low rate of revision and adverse events after surgery. When discussing treatment choice, men and those aged 40-49 years should be counselled for a higher, but still low overall risk of further intervention.

#### System error in the national PROMS programme for knee arthroplasty: an update

##### Aims
The Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) NHS Foundation Trust was a negative outlier for post-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) after primary knee arthroplasty in 2015/16. The aims of this study were determine if (1) the NHS Digital (NHSD) Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) programme included primary UKA when calculating adjusted gain in OKS; (2) to calculate an estimated impact of excluding primary UKA on OKS gains for primary knee arthroplasty and (3) to assess the real world impact of updated programme criteria on OUH Trust results.

##### Methods
National PROMs data from England (2012 to 2016) were analysed. Inclusion of UKA cases in the national PROMs programme was determined using clinical codes. Local OKS gain was calculated for UKA and TKA and compared to published PROMs results for 2012/13. Published PROMs results for 2017/18 and 2018/19 were reviewed to determine if code updates resulted in real world change.

##### Results
Use of recommended codes for primary UKA excluded >97% of cases from the PROMs programme. Inclusion of primary UKAs improved the OUH Trust OKS gain from 15.1 (below average) to 16.3 (above average) for 2012/13 for primary knee arthroplasty. NHSD reports for 2017/18 and 2018/19 demonstrated positive outlier status for the OUH Trust.

##### Conclusions
Exclusion of UKA patients from the PROMs programme is a nationwide issue, potentially introducing bias when comparing OKS gain between centres. A positive impact on the OUH Trust’s published results for primary knee arthroplasty has likely resulted from inclusion of the UKA clinical code in the national programme.

#### Military clothing effects on gunshot wound patterns within a cadaveric animal limb model

#### Aims
Extremity injuries typically predominate in survivors of gunshot wounds (GSW). Novel wound ballistic research is encouraged to help maintain corporate knowledge on the management of these injuries gained during recent conflicts and to understand the wounding patterns identified. A paucity of literature exists on examining the effect of clothing on wounding patterns, with recent work examining the effect of military clothing on GSW patterns in a synthetic gelatine model. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of UK military clothing on GSW patterns within a cadaveric animal limb model using two types of ammunition commonly found in recent conflicts – 7.62 x 39 mm and 5.45 x 39 mm.

##### Methods
Twenty four fallow deer hind limbs were shot in total, 12 with 7.62 mm projectiles and the remaining 12 shot with 5.45 mm projectiles, further divided into four without any clothing layers (Cnil), four with a single clothing layer (Cmin) and four with maximum clothing layers (Cmax) as worn on active duty by UK military personnel. Limbs were analysed after ballistic impact using contrast CT scanning to obtain measurements of permanent cavity damage, and results compared using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

##### Results
Results showed significantly different damage measurements within limbs with Cmax for both ammunition types when compared to the other clothing states.

##### Conclusions
The use of Cmax may result in GSWs that necessitate more extensive surgical management, inviting further study.

#### Modulating tendon fibroblast activation with synthetic extracellular matrix

##### Background
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a natural topographical blueprint that guides cellular shape and behaviour. Through the careful manipulation of parameters such as fibre alignment and diameter, synthetic electrospun materials can recapitulate this ECM environment and may enable modulation of the aberrant cellular phenotypes present within diseased tendon. In the context of human rotator cuff tendon disease, fibroblasts demonstrate an activated and pro-inflammatory phenotype. We sought to characterise and compare the effect of different, synthetic, ECM architectures on the transcriptome of fibroblasts isolated from healthy and diseased tendons.

##### Methods
Tendon fibroblasts (tenocyte) were isolated from healthy hamstrings (n=3) and massive rotator cuff tendon tears (n=3). Electrospun scaffolds were produced with fibres in aligned or random orientations, but with matching fibre diameters of approximately 300,1000,2000 and 4000nm. Fibroblasts were cultured on scaffolds for 7 days prior to harvesting for bulk mRNA sequencing.

##### Results
Diseased tendon fibroblasts demonstrated an upregulation of PDPN, FAP, VCAM1 and CD248, corresponding to a positive enrichment for gene-sets describing inflammatory regulation, cytokine release, ECM production and immune cell activation. For both healthy and diseased tenocytes, aligned electrospun scaffolds with diameters above 1000nm resulted in an alteration in fibroblast cell shape, which was associated with a downregulation of ‘activated’ gene-sets. Conversely, small diameter (~300nm) aligned and randomly orientated scaffolds produced a relative activation.

##### Conclusions
Electrospun scaffolds are capable of modulating tenocyte activation. Scaffolds resembling smaller diameter, disordered, collagen III typically present during the earlier phases of wound healing, resulted in tenocyte activation. Conversely, scaffolds mimicking aligned larger diameter collagen I fibrils, present during tissue remodelling, did not activate tendon derived fibroblasts. This has implications for the design of scaffolds used during rotator cuff repair augmentation. Future work will correlate long-term in vivo outcomes with scaffold induced changes to the activation signature of tendon fibroblasts.
