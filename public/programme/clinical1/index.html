<h5 id="aim">Aim</h5>

<p>To determine if having an overweight or obese range BMI when beginning school is associated with increased fracture incidence in childhood.</p>

<h5 id="methods">Methods</h5>

<p>A dynamic cohort was created from children presenting for routine pre-school primary care screening in Catalonia, Spain. Data were collected from 296 primary care centres representing 74% of the regional paediatric population. 466,997 children with a validated weight and height measurement at 4 years of age (±6 months) between 2006-2013 were included, and followed up to the age of 15, migration out of region, death, or until 31/12/2016. BMI was calculated and classified using WHO growth tables. Fractures were identified using previously validated ICD10 codes in electronic primary care records, divided by anatomical location. Actuarial lifetables were used to calculate cumulative incidence. Cox regression was used to investigate the association of BMI category and fracture risk with adjustment for socioeconomic status, age, sex, and nationality.</p>

<h5 id="results">Results</h5>

<p>Median follow up was 4.90 years (IQR 2.50 to 7.61). Cumulative incidence of any fracture during childhood was 9.20% (95% CI 3.79-14.61) for underweight, 10.06% (9.82-10.29) for normal weight, 11.28% (10.22-12.35) for overweight children, and 13.05% (10.69% to 15.41%) for children with obesity. Overweight and obese range BMI was associated with an excess risk of lower limb (adjusted HR 1.42 [1.26-1.59]; 1.74 [1.46- 2.06] respectively) and upper limb fracture (adjHR 1.10 [1.03-1.17]; 1.19 [1.07-1.31]).</p>

<h5 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h5>

<p>Pre-school children with an overweight or obese range BMI had increased incidence of upper and lower limb fractures in childhood compared to contemporaries of normal weight.</p>

<h4 id="patterns-of-pain-after-joint-arthroplasty-a-novel-technique-for-comparison">Patterns of pain after joint arthroplasty: A novel technique for comparison</h4>

<h5 id="aims">Aims</h5>

<p>Around 9% of patients undergoing Total Hip Replacement and 20% undergoing Total Knee Replacement are dissatisfied with ongoing pain at one year post surgery. Studies have been performed to identify pre-operative predictors, many of which considered levels of pain. We aimed to determine if patients with significant pain at one year post THA or TKA experienced different patterns of pain in the first six weeks post-operatively.</p>

<h5 id="methods-1">Methods</h5>

<p>Consecutive patients undergoing THA and TKA were recruited. They were required to complete pain diaries for the first six weeks post-operatively. Graphs with the pattern of pain for a single day, and over a six weeks period were produced for each patient. The “card-sorting” technique was performed by independent assessors who grouped patients according to the shape of their pain patterns. These groups were compared for significant differences in their pain scores and OHS/OKS scores at one year post-op.</p>

<h5 id="results-1">Results</h5>

<p>A total of 80 patients were recruited, 41 underwent THA and 39 underwent TKA. Distinctive patterns of pain were found in each group, for both pain variation across any given 24 hour period, and across a six-week period.  Comparing these groups of patients showed no difference in OHS/OKS or pain at one year post-operatively.</p>

<h5 id="discussion">Discussion</h5>

<p>Although no differences were found between patients grouped by pattern of pain exhibited, this paper utilised a novel method of objectively quantifying and comparing patterns of pain, rather than static figures. This is an accepted technique used commonly in the field of computer science and has potential for other applications.</p>

<h4 id="risk-factors-for-dislocation-after-total-hip-arthroplasty-for-trauma">Risk factors for dislocation after total hip arthroplasty for trauma</h4>

<h5 id="background">Background</h5>

<p>Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is increasingly used for active patients with displaced intracapsular hip fractures. Dislocation rates in this cohort remain high postoperatively compared to elective practice, yet it remains unclear which patients are most at risk. The aim of this study was to determine the dislocation rate for these patients and to evaluate the contributing patient and surgeon factors.</p>

<h5 id="methods-2">Methods</h5>

<p>A five-year retrospective analysis of all patients receiving THA for displaced intracapsular hip fractures from 2013-18 was performed. Data was collected from the institutions&rsquo; hip fracture database, including data submitted to the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD).  Cox regression analysis and log-rank tests were implemented to evaluate factors associated with THA dislocation. Patient age, sex, ASA grade, surgeon seniority, surgical approach, femoral head diameter and acetabular cup type were all investigated as independent factors.</p>

<h5 id="results-2">Results</h5>

<p>A total of 196 patients, with a mean age of 72 (range 49-90), received THA for hip fracture between 2013-18. A posterior approach, using standard cemented acetabular components and a 28mm femoral head, was used in 133 cases (72%).
Fourteen dislocations (7%) were observed during this period, with 5 patients requiring revision surgery. Of these dislocations, all were performed through posterior approaches with standard cemented cups. 28mm femoral heads were used in all cases except one, which used a 32mm femoral head.
In Cox regression analysis, ASA grade, but not age or sex, was significantly associated with dislocation (hazard ratio = 4.5; 95% confidence interval 2.0-10.0; p&lt;0.001). On log rank testing no statistically significant association was found between dislocation and surgeon grade (p=0.85), surgical approach (p=0.31), femoral head size (p=0.85) or cup type (p=0.30).</p>

<h5 id="discussion-1">Discussion</h5>

<p>This study demonstrates an increased risk of dislocation following THA for hip fracture with higher ASA grades. It may be appropriate to offer more stable implants to this cohort of patients.</p>

<h4 id="the-arthroscopic-latarjet-a-multi-surgeon-learning-curve-analysis">The Arthroscopic Latarjet: A Multi-Surgeon Learning Curve Analysis</h4>

<h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>

<p>The open Latarjet procedure is a standard surgical treatment option for anterior shoulder instability in patients with a high risk of failure following soft tissue stabilisation. The arthroscopic technique has potential advantages of minimal invasiveness, reduced postoperative stiffness and faster rehabilitation, but is regarded as technically challenging, with concern over surgical risk during the learning curve. The aim of this study was to undertake a multi-surgeon, large volume learning curve analysis of the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure employing continuous learning curve analysis.</p>

<h5 id="methods-3">Methods</h5>

<p>Prospectively collected data from 12 surgeons across 5 countries was reviewed. A total of573 patients undergoing the arthroscopic Latarjet procedure were included. Outcome measures of learning were collected including operative time, CT bone-block positioning, complications, and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs). A novel, validated, segmented linear regression modelling technique was used for learning curve analysis.</p>

<h5 id="results-3">Results</h5>

<p>High-volume surgeons converged to an operative time steady state after 30-50 cases. Surgeons completing fewer procedures demonstrated a constant reduction in operative time without reaching a plateau. Low-volume surgeons completing fewer than 14 operations did not show evidence of learning. Accuracy of bone-block positioning on postoperative CT demonstrated constant improvement without reaching a plateau after 89 cases. There was no change in PROMs or complications with increased operative volume.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>Specialist shoulder surgeons require 30-50 arthroscopic Latarjet procedures to attain steady-state operative efficiency, during which there is improvement in bone-block positioning. Only surgeons expecting to undertake the arthroscopic Latarjet in high-volume should consider adopting this procedure.</p>

<h4 id="does-tendon-gap-affect-patient-reported-outcomes-following-conservative-management-of-complete-achilles-tendon-rupture-using-functional-bracing">Does tendon gap affect patient reported outcomes following conservative management of complete Achilles Tendon rupture using functional bracing?</h4>

<h5 id="aims-1">Aims</h5>

<p>To determine whether the size of the gap in Achilles Tendon (AT) ruptures significantly influences functional outcome for patients managed non operatively with a functional bracing protocol.</p>

<h5 id="methods-4">Methods</h5>

<p>Records from specific AT clinics were interrogated to identify a consecutive series of patients. Data were collected on the size of the gap between ruptured tendon ends on ultrasound scan in plantar flexion and Achilles Tendon Rehabilitation Scores (ATRS) at 6 and 12 months post injury. Additional data were recorded for secondary outcome measures and patients treated surgically with primary repair.</p>

<h5 id="results-4">Results</h5>

<p>148 patients presented to our hospital over 2.5 years. 87% (n=129) were treated using a functional bracing protocol and 96 met the inclusion criteria. The median age of patients was 49 (range 21-91) and the median tendon gap was 5.6mm (range 0-43). Tendon ruptures occurred between 15 – 150mm from the calcaneal insertion. The average ATRS score at 6 months was 69, rising to 79 at 12 months. There was no statistical relationship between size of gap and ATRS score at either time period. Eleven patients were managed primarily with surgery and these ATRS scores did not differ significantly from the braced cohort.</p>

<h5 id="conclusions-1">Conclusions</h5>

<p>No relationship between tendon gap distance and functional outcome was identified. This supports our belief that there is no absolute value over which surgery needs to be offered for AT ruptures when using our functional bracing protocol. Similarly, surgical repair did not provide superior functional recovery to bracing when measured with the validated ATRS questionnaire.</p>

<h4 id="demographic-study-of-hip-fractures-in-the-maltese-islands">Demographic Study of Hip Fractures in the Maltese Islands</h4>

<h5 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h5>

<p>Despite hip fractures being a great public health burden, only few studies have analyzed the relationship between hip fracture incidence and socioeconomic status. Many studies found an association; however, results are in part conflicting.</p>

<h5 id="objective">Objective</h5>

<p>To analyse the impact of regional-level socioeconomic status on the incidence of hip fractures in the Maltese Islands.</p>

<h5 id="method">Method</h5>

<p>All individuals older than 50 years who presented to the acute care hospitals in Malta and Gozo with low-energy hip fractures between December 1, 2015, and November 30, 2016, were selected. Data on individual demographics, hip fracture type, surgical intervention, and hospital stay were collected. The percentage of hip fracture and socioeconomic status of each region in the Maltese Islands were calculated. These were then analyzed for any statistical association.</p>

<h5 id="results-5">Results</h5>

<p>A moderate negative correlation (r <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> 􏰀0.5987, N <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> 454, P &lt; .05) was found between the socioeconomic status and the incidence of hip fracture in each region. There was 5.9% (n <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> 27) mortality rate posed by these hip fractures. The average duration of hospital stay was 14 days, with an average delay to surgical intervention of 2 days.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h5>

<p>Despite the Maltese Islands having a small population (429 344 people) and a free universal national health service, our results show that districts with low socioeconomic status had a higher incidence of hip fracture. Further studies using individual socioeconomic data and longer duration are required.</p>

<h4 id="limited-sequence-mri-for-the-investigation-of-cauda-equina-compression">Limited Sequence MRI for the Investigation of Cauda Equina Compression</h4>

<h5 id="aims-2">Aims</h5>

<p>To determine whether limited sequence MRIs in the investigation of suspected cauda equina compression is safe.</p>

<h5 id="methods-5">Methods</h5>

<p>A limited sequence MRI protocol for suspected cauda equina compression was implemented at two district general hospitals for patients under the age of 55. All medical notes were reviewed for patients investigated between 1st September 2017 and 31st July 2018.</p>

<h5 id="results-6">Results</h5>

<p>190 patients underwent 198 limited sequence lumbar-sacral MRI scans. 131 (66.2%) of scans were performed in women, 67 (33.8%) in men. 14 (7%) cases of cauda equina compression were identified who went on to have surgical decompression. 5 patients had repeat scans. Other pathologies identified on the scans included disc protrusions (95 cases, 48%), stenosis (9 cases, 4.5%), degenerative changes (6 cases, 3%), post-operative changes, discitis and fracture. 82 (41.4%) of the scans did not identify findings that could account for the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and were described as &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. We have not identified any &ldquo;missed&rdquo; cases of cauda equina compression using the limited sequence MRI protocol. Average time for the limited sequence MRI was 9 minutes 56 seconds.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h5>

<p>No cases of cauda equina compression were missed using the limited sequence MRI. Further evidence is needed before this protocol can be recommended for the investigation of cauda equina compression.</p>

<h4 id="modified-dunn-osteotomy-for-sufe-the-royal-berkshire-experience">Modified Dunn Osteotomy For SUFE: The Royal Berkshire Experience</h4>

<h5 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h5>

<p>The modified Dunn technique is a combination of surgical hip dislocation, subcapital crescenteric osteotomy, epiphyseal realignment and internal fixation which has been described for treatment of Slipped Upper Femoral Epiphysis (SUFE). We describe how the technique is performed and the rehab protocol in our unit and present our case series of patients.</p>

<h5 id="methods-6">Methods</h5>

<p>A retrospective case review was undertaken for all patients treated with this procedure from 2012 to present.</p>

<h5 id="results-7">Results</h5>

<p>22 patients were identified. Most cases were male (n=14), acute on chronic slips (n=10), the average age was 13 years old (range 11-15) and a significant number of patients were obese (n=9). The average Southwick angle was 53 degrees with most slips classified as ‘severe’. Average follow up was 22 months. 9 patients had excellent outcome, 3 were lost to follow up, 2 had symptomatic leg length discrepancy, 2 had symptomatic lateral screw heads, there were 2 cases of early subluxation and 4 cases of avascular necrosis (AVN). Of the AVN cases, 2 went on to have total hip arthroplasty and 2 had removal of metalwork.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion-3">Conclusion</h5>

<p>We describe our experience of this technique for moderate to severe SUFE and our outcomes over a 7-year period with overall good outcomes and AVN rates comparable to the previous literature.</p>
